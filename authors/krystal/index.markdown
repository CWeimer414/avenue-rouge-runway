Hi Avenue Rouge readers! I’m Krystal Bennett, a local blogger and graphic designer who will be keying you into all of the must-know information preceding this year’s runway show. Why me? Good question – As an art major and designer, I have a certain obsession with detail and good design whether it’s art, clothing or a pair of knockout heels. I share these things daily on my blog [A Pinch of Lovely](http://apinchoflovely.blogspot.com), a little spot in cyberspace that holds all of my favorite people, spaces, projects, outfits and more!

Take a look around and if you like what you see, make sure to check back as I do double duty for the next month blogging for both A Pinch of Lovely AND the Avenue Rouge Runway blog!

Think of me as your new friend as I help get you runway ready along with Jenn from Haute Off the Rack. We have a LOT of amazing and original content coming your way, and we’ll be spilling more info in our first Avenue Rouge newsletter post on August 28th!
