# About My Personal Style:

My personal style always reflects my daily mood and personality.  I’m vivacious, zealous, self-confident, a tad dramatic and always eager for new and exciting things. With that being said, I usually aim for bright colors, fashion forward items, and classic pieces that I can update with chic accessories and statement jewelry.   Since I’m a well-organized person, no matter what I wear my outfit always looks very tailored and put together. However, one may consider my style continually evolving because I thrive on new looks and trends.  Any time I spot a new fun new trend I find a way to incorporate it into my style and make it my own.

# Five Fun Facts About Me:

1. Cupcakes, chocolate-chip cookies, snowballs and accessories are my weaknesses.
2. I used sing and do theatre performance and sometimes wish that I still did. 
3. I feel the most alive when I’m on stage or in front of a camera.
4. Southern California is my happy place, which is where I’m originally from. 
5. And for those of you who are wondering, I am half Filipino and half Italian.
