Like nature changing it’s color palette from summer to fall, it’s also time to change our own colors choices. With the new season and a farewell to August, you can expect to see light and airy hues getting replaced with bold, saturated ones. The easiest place to start incorporating these new colors into your wardrobe now – your accessories. To scope out the best in color accessories, I visited [Kiki in Perkins Rowe](https://www.facebook.com/shopkiki) to see its new fall arrivals. 

Let’s start with handbags (my favorite)! I’m looking forward to utilizing blue and green bags this season – they’re going to be major color components. Pair them with neutral ensembles or wear them with another bold color like jade or eggplant for a colorblocked look. This Marc Jacobs clutch and Rebecca Minkoff Mini MAC are just the right sized purses to make a conservative color statement.

Since you’ve got your colored handbag down, let’s add some more hues into your wristwear. These Chan Luu leather beaded bracelets are versatile and under $30! They come in some great seasonal colors like orange and teal. Wear them together or match them with bracelets you already have. These are great, affordable pieces for a quick and easy color update.

Let’s talk about metallic accessories now. A look that’s normally too heavy for spring or summer, THIS is the season to mix your metals. And not only metals – but textures. Texture is what makes fall fashion so interesting. Experiment with beads, chain link and leather as well as gold, silver and bronze. Layer and mix metallics over your colored tops.

And last but not least, the oh-so-popular, fall staple – the scarf. A patterned scarf for me is a game changer. You could have a really boring outfit on, and by simply throwing on an interesting scarf, you can completely change your look. Look for unique patterns and color combinations like this one from Cut25. It’s a perfect transition piece because it pairs summery citron and light blue with navy. (Also, look into new ways to tie your scarves.)
