## A New Post

What are the “it” colors for Fall 2013 beauty products you ask?  Well, I am no beauty expert so I went to professional makeup artist, Ashley Sievert for advice on which new colors to incorporate into my makeup this fall.  To answer your question, this season’s “it” colors are a matte berry for the lips, a gold amber shadow for the eyes and a nude blush for your cheeks, says Sievert.

See the soft gold amber shadow that Sievert applied to my eyes in the photo above.

This neutral makeup palate makes perfect sense considering that this year’s “it” colors for fashion are bold hues like emerald green, cobalt blue and burgundy. A nude blush and gold amber shadow will complement these colors beautifully without stealing the spotlight from your outfit.
As far as lip colors, a matte berry lip is a nice contrast between all three of these colors.  However, I also like to wear a hint of hot pink for a bright pop of color when wearing black.

I also love wearing a classic red with black and gold.  A bright red lip will really make your gold statement jewelry pop.

Last of all, to help you keep that end-of-summer glow from Labor Day weekend, you’ll need Kismet Body Bronzing Lotion by Caitlin Picou.
