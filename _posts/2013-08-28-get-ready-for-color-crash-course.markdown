Rev up your style skills and take the “Color Crash Course” for the 2013 Avenue Rouge Runway Show with [Krystal Bennett](/authors/krystal) of [A Pinch of Lovely](http://apinchoflovely.com) and [Jennifer Palpallatoc](/authors/jennifer) from [Haute Off the Rack](http://hauteofftherack.com)! 

1. Buckle up and gear into colorful accessories.
2. Avoid color roadblocks and learn how to navigate through bright hues.
3. Shift out of neutral and into neon.
4. Hit the brakes on black and floor it into prints and patterns.
5. Fuel up on jewel tones and metallics and peel out in style.
