##Big Trends Seen Around Town
###Feline Footwear
There has been a recent surge in feline fashion pieces for fall. From sweaters, crop tops and tees, the cat family is having a major moment. The most recent item they've taken over – flats! In all different colors, materials and cats of your choosing, these new pieces have been popping up all over town. I spotted these luxe Leoffler Randall Tiger flats at EDIT by LBP and these kitten-faced, black flats at Frock Candy at Perkins Rowe. Pair them both with jewel tones for a chic but playful look!

###Embellished Collars
Collars really took the stage last fall/winter and are now back and better than ever. Intricate beading and even simplistic rhinestones will draw the eye to the neckline without having to enlist the help of a necklace. The trend crosses from everyday fashion to even bridal fashion. This green top from Frock Candy can be worn for the day-or-night occasion, and this amazing beaded beauty from I Do Bridal Boutique can be worn for your BIG day!

###Metallic Clutches
Want to pack a big punch with a small purse? Opt for a metallic clutch. These are such great staple pieces because metals can literally be paired with any color in your closet. If you’re feeling like you’ve mastered gold and silver, check out this pretty rose gold option at EDIT by LBP. Or if you’re playing with the idea of working more metallic into your wardrobe, start with a classic gold clutch like this one from Frock Candy. It will help introduce you to the trend without breaking your budget!
